# In our case, due to the use of PIX4Dtagger in our pipeline, chili tags were required for the point cloud processing with georeferences.
# Therefore, chili tags were applied in a small consistent distance with respect to the the CWA markers on every markers.
# Typically, a surveyor is required to measure the markers(in this case, CWA) within the project coordinate system.
# This data is then put in the file markers_ifc.xlsx under the markers folder. If there are other tags required for the project, for example, 
# other robots that are using different kinds of tags, different tags can also be applied on the CWA markers like in our case with chili tags.

### Required Programs and Licenses

#### 1. PIX4Dmapper, photogrammetry software

`pybimscantools` associates with photogrammetry software, `PIX4Dmapper`. The user is required to have the photogrammetry software installed with a working license. The lastest version of `PIX4Dmapper` that `pybimscantools` supports is `4.5.6` due to the need of PIX4Dtagger integrated in this PIX4Dmapper specific version.
The user is required to install PIX4Dmapper in a typical location, `C:\Program Files\Pix4Dmapper`. Once installed, extract the DB profile of PIX4Dmapper from the folder `PIX4D_DB_PROFILES` and place them in PIX4D database location.

```
- Extract the zipped file, you will see 2 folders (common, and Pix4D mapper)
- Place the extracted folders under the PIX4D database location.
- Usually under C:\Users\{YOUR-USER}\AppData\Local\pix4d
```

#### 2. drone harmony, drone mission planning software

`pybimscantools` also associates with `drone harmony` software to visualize representations of construction site and partially automate the mission planning process. The user is required to have a working license with `drone harmony` as well as the `API_KEY` from drone harmony. `API_KEY` is required to be entered in the program (e.g. `test.py`).
